Here are some ideas to improve the application:

- [x] Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
- [x] Add support for nicknames.
- [x] Make nickname persistent over TAB reloads until manually removed. (sessionStorage, not localStorage)
- [x] Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he/she presses enter. (Doesn't make much sense)
- [x] Add “{user} is typing” functionality.
- [x] Show who’s online.
- [x] Private messaging.
- [x] Add new private message notifications and put on top of online users list
- [x] Using commands like `/text-green-500` to colorize message, suggestions when typing command
