# Homework

Here are some ideas to improve the application:

- [x] Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
- [x] Add support for nicknames.
- [x] Make nickname persistent over TAB reloads until manually removed. (sessionStorage, not localStorage)
- [x] Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he/she presses enter.
- [x] Add “{user} is typing” functionality.
- [ ] Show who’s online.
- [ ] Text wrap when msg too long, or limit chars length
- [ ] Add private messaging.
